- **Production Feature Detection**: Automatically includes all security and performance optimizations
- **Instant Updates**: Migration files update immediately when schema changes

### 2. Git Integration Hooks
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Updates migrations before every commit
- **Post-merge Hook**: Updates migrations after pulling changes
- **Automatic Staging**: Updated migration files are automatically added to commits

### 3. Production Feature Auto-Detection
- **Performance Indexes**: Automatically includes all database indexes
- **Security Features**: Session management, audit logging, user authentication
- **Production Headers**: Comprehensive documentation and compatibility notes
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Company-based architecture detection

### 4. Validation System
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensures all production features are included
- **Current Date Validation**: Confirms migration files are up-to-date
- **Feature Detection**: Validates security, performance, and monitoring capabilities

## System Components

### Core Scripts

#### `scripts/generate-migration.js`
- **Auto-Enhanced Generation**: Detects and includes production features
- **Schema Analysis**: Reads schema file to determine capabilities
- **Production Headers**: Adds comprehensive documentation automatically
- **Feature Detection**: Identifies indexes, security, and multi-tenant features

#### `scripts/validate-migration.js`
- **Production Readiness Check**: Validates all required features
- **Current Date Verification**: Ensures migration is up-to-date
- **Feature Completeness**: Checks indexes, security, session management
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Clear indication of migration readiness

#### `scripts/dev-migration-watcher.js`
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Watches schema and server files
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive regeneration
- **Development Mode**: Continuous monitoring during development
- **Production File Detection**: Monitors security and performance files

#### `scripts/setup-auto-migration.sh`
- **System Installation**: Sets up all automation hooks
- **Git Hook Creation**: Installs pre-commit and post-merge hooks
- **Permission Setup**: Makes all scripts executable
- **Validation Integration**: Includes completeness checking

### Git Hooks

#### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
# Automatically runs before every commit
# Updates migration files if schema.ts has changed
# Adds updated files to the commit automatically
```

#### Post-merge Hook
```bash
# Automatically runs after git pull/merge
# Updates migration files if schema changes were pulled
# Ensures local migration files stay current
```

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Run once to set up the automated system
./scripts/setup-auto-migration.sh
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start real-time migration watching during development
node scripts/dev-migration-watcher.js
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
# Manual migration update
node scripts/generate-migration.js

# Validate current migration
node scripts/validate-migration.js

# Complete update with validation
./scripts/update-migration.sh
```

### Build Process Integration
```bash
# The system automatically runs before builds
# Ensures production deployments have current migrations
# No manual intervention required
```

## Production Features Automatically Included

### Database Performance
- **Company Indexes**: name, active status for fast lookups
- **Sales Indexes**: company_id, hotel_id, date, created_at for dashboard queries
- **Payment Indexes**: sale_id for transaction lookups
- **Audit Indexes**: user_id, table_name, timestamp for compliance queries
- **Session Indexes**: expire for cleanup operations

### Security Features
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based secure sessions
- **User Authentication**: Password hashing and role-based access
- **Audit Logging**: Complete change tracking with user context
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and constraints

### Production Readiness
- **Connection Pooling**: Environment-appropriate connection limits
- **Error Handling**: Production-safe error responses
- **Health Monitoring**: Database connectivity checks
- **Scalability**: Multi-tenant architecture support

## Validation Checklist

The automated validation ensures these features are always included:

✅ **Performance Indexes**: All critical database indexes present
✅ **Production Header**: Comprehensive documentation and compatibility
✅ **Session Management**: Secure session handling configuration
✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete change tracking system
✅ **User Authentication**: Secure user management system
✅ **Current Date**: Migration file is up-to-date

## Benefits

## Troubleshooting

### If Validation Fails
```bash
# Re-run generation to fix any issues
node scripts/generate-migration.js

# Validate the fix
node scripts/validate-migration.js
```

### For Git Hook Issues
```bash
# Re-run setup to restore hooks
./scripts/setup-auto-migration.sh
```

### For Development Watching
```bash
# Restart the watcher if it stops
node scripts/dev-migration-watcher.js
```
